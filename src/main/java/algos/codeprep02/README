# 1

You are given a string representing a sequence of N arrows each pointing in one of the four cardinal directions:
up('^'), down('v'), left('<'), right('>').

Write a function solution that, given a string S denoting the directions of the arrows, return the minimum number
of arrows that must be rotated to make them all point in the same direction.

Examples:

1. Given S = "^vv<v", the function should return 2. After rotation both the first ('^') and fourth ("<") arrows
downwards ('v'), all of the arrows would point down.

2. Given S = "v>>>vv", the function should return 3. After rotating first, fifth and sixth arrow rightwards,
all the arrows would point right.

3. Given S = "<<<" the function should return 0. All the arrows already point left.

Assume that:
    - N is an integer within the range [1..100];
    - string S consists only of the following characters: "^", "v", "<", and/or ">".

In your solution focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
