# Code Differently Message Encryptor

Students at Code Differently want to pass notes to one another. In case a note is confiscated
by a staff member, the students decide to encrypt the messages. They do so by shifting each letter
in the `message` by a `shift`.

## Example

### Input
Message: Kaleb
Shift 3

### Output
Ndohe

### Explanation
```
K => +3 => N
a -> +3 -> d
l -> +3 -> o
e -> +3 -> h
b -> +3 -> e
```

# Added new feature
The last encryptor has some limitations, it shifts text correctly, but it shifts all punctuation
and whitespace too! Let's fix this!

## Example

### Input
Message: Hello, World!
Shift 3

### Output
Khoor, Zruog!

### Explanation
Note that the letters shift as before but non letters stay the same


#Added new feature

Out updated encryptor still had some issues, it shifts text correctly, but does not wrap around
to the beginning again. A shift of one to z didn't produce an a! Let's fix it!

## Example

### Input
Message: Hello, World!
Shift 4

### Output
Lipps, Asvph!

### Explanation
Note that the letters shift as before but non letters stay the same
